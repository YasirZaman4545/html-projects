             Self introduction is an opportunity for you to talk 
             about yourself, your personality, highlight your strengths, hobbies, skills, and experience, clearly and confidently.
            Whether you are introducing yourself to the university admissions committee, your classroom, your instructors,
               or anyone else, really, a self introduction gives you the chance to help people see who you are as well as understand your goals and ambitions.
